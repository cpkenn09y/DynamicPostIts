## Brief Overview
* This is a fun app that allows users to click anywhere to dynamically create a new post it

### (Pair with Daniel)
* Daniel and I paired through this mini-project and it was a nice way to start the day.
* Made post-its draggable, editable, and destroyable

### (Solo)
* Made post-it content scrollable upon exceeding set height
* Implemented randomization of title messages to passively teach users how to interact with the post-its
